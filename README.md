# Вook shop
This is a web application for an online bookstore. The system has two main roles: buyer (User) and administrator (Admin). Buyers can register, log in, browse and search for books, add them to their cart, place orders, and view their purchase history. The administrator manages the store's catalog: adding, editing, and deleting books and categories, as well as changing order statuses.
The application implements the following key entities: user, role, book, category, cart, cart items, order, and order items. The project is being developed in stages and hosted in a separate GitHub repository as a portfolio project. The Checkstyle plugin is also being added to the project to ensure compliance with coding standards.
